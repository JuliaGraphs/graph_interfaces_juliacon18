## Graph interfaces in Julia

This talk on LightGraphs was presented at JuliaCon 2018 by
[James Fairbanks](https://github.com/jpfairbanks) and
[Mathieu Besançon](https://github.com/matbesancon). It covers what LightGraphs
is, its scope and its relation to other packages and how to use it as a package developer.

## The JuliaGraphs Ecosystem: build fast -- don’t break things

This second talk on the JuliaGraphs ecosystem is a retrospective
of the year and what we've learned developing and maturing the packages
towards the 1.0 version.
